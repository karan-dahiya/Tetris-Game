// The Gameboard class encapsulates the functionality of the Tetris game board.
//
// The Gameboard class has no concept of what a tetromino is!
// This is intentional.  It helps to keep the gameboard as modular and as simple
// as possible. The gameboard class simply manages a 2D array of content
// (integers). Each integer of content can represent either an empty spot, or a
// color.  Gameboard member functions operate on that content (particularly on
// rows) to facilitate operations that happen on a Tetris gameboard (checking for
// a complete row, filling a row, copying a row, collapsing rows, etc…).
//
// Actual gameplay is handled by a separate class (which makes use of the gameboard).
// We will handle this in a future lab. To get a sense of the bigger picture and how 
// the gameboard is used : a GridTetromino (a special Tetromino that has knowledge of
// its location on a co-ordinate system) will eventually reach a location on the 
// gameboard where it cannot move down any further (because the points that it would
// occupy already contain content).  At this point, the information a Tetromino 
// contains about its blocks (location and color) will be copied to the gameboard grid.
// We use the gameboard to determine what locations are already occupied as a result of 
// previous tetromino being “locked” (where its blocks are copied to the gameboard).
// 
// Displaying the board(via text output) should show empty spots, and areas where blocks
// of color(content) have been copied("locked") onto the board from tetrominos that have
// already been placed(either intentionally or not).
//
// - The game board is represented by a 2D array of integers(the grid).
// - The array contains content(integers) which represent either :
//    - an EMPTY_BLOCK(-1),
//    - a color from the Tetromino::TetColor enum.
// - This 2D array is oriented with [0][0] at the top left and [MAX_Y][MAX_X] at the
//      bottom right.  Why?  It makes the board much easier to draw the grid on the 
//      screen later because this is the same way things are drawn on a screen 
//      co-ordinate system (where pixel 0,0 is considered top left).
// - A 2D array uses row - major ordering by default – which means that the first index
//      is the row and the second is the column.eg: grid[row][col]. However it will be
//      easier for us to think of this grid in terms of XY coordinates. Here’s the 
//      catch… X represents columns and Y represents rows.  (I know this seems counter-
//      intuitive, but to make sense of it - think of pixels on a screen, or XY 
//      co-ordinates on a co-ordinate system)  
// - This means that when we index into a 2D array with an x, y co - ordinate, we are 
//      going to need to reverse what we would probably do naturally : (grid[x][y]), 
//      and index the grid the other way around(grid[y][x]). We will only need to do 
//      this within the gameboard class (since grid is a private member variable). 
//		We are using abstraction to hide the details of implementation inside the class.
//      If we call member functions that are public (eg : setContent(x, y, content))
//      we can treat X and Y as we normally would,
//
//  [expected .cpp size: ~ 225 lines (including method comments)]
